<--- Week 1 & 2 JavaScript & Node.js --->

While learning popular web technologies, the focus of the first two weeks is on helping students appreciate what it means to be a good developer. We want students to become developers that know many technologies, as well as one that has a good approach, rapid experimentation, incremental building, and sharp debugging skills.

1. JavaScript & Node.js
2. Express, MongoDB & JSON
3. Git & GitHub

::Projects to try::
GitrDone: A command-line client application that communicates with GitHub's public API. 
TinyApp: A bit.ly-like URL shortener.



<--- Week 3 & 4 Front-End Development & Group Projects  --->

Building on the coding concepts and technologies learned in the first two weeks, the focus shifts towards front-end programming. Once students are comfortable with HTML & CSS, we’ll introduce them to working with relational databases & SQL, which are extremely prevalent in most web applications.
